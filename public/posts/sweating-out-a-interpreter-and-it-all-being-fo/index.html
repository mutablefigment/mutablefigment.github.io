  <div class="book-post-content"><p>Looking for a job is never fun so I was pretty happy when I got an offer for a dev position and it even was in the language I had my first real job in (and that I still love) Delphi</p>
<p>Delphi jobs being rare af I was pretty stoked to be able to work in Delphi again and with some nice people that all were pretty friendly in the interviews</p>
<p>The interviewer asked me to bring a Delphi project I had previously worked on, a pretty impossible ask given that I wrote medical software previously so NDAs up the ass besides I don’t take source code from work home especially not after leaving a company?!</p>
<p>So I foolishly offered to write a pretty basic programming language for them, remember I really wanted the job and wanted to impress.</p>
<p>So there I was at 6pm after coming home from my day job as the head of it security for a company, now having to write a compiler …<br>
So I did the only reasonable thing made myself an espresso and out a simple interpreter written in object pascal (because Borland don’t run on Linux and it’s not free, how are new developers supposed to enter your language ecosystem lmao?)</p>
<p>Well after a long sleepless night it was done and pretty disgusting so the day after just before the interview where I was supposed to present the code I did some quick fixes and headed of to their offices, during the technical interview the lead engineer showed me their code base and we had a pretty good discussion and great time after around 4 hours (it now being 10pm) he said “and you brought us something as well?”</p>
<p>He took a single look just said “yeah that looks like pascal”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>And that was it?! I left feeling pretty annoyed having invested my sanity into writing this project with a 2 day delivery window as well as having to work a stressful 8 hour work day on top.<br>
In the end I can only blame myself for having the idea and even proposing such an insane project for a technical interview. No fault on their side, yet I would have at least wished for a more in depth talk about my efforts.</p>
<p>It all comes back to the old adage “we did it not because it was easy, but because we thought it would be easy”</p>
<p>To round it all off I have to say the company was a great place to work at even though I left a bit disappointed that evening, it felt like a family and work was pretty fun there all things considered :)</p>
<p>Alas on to a new company with new projects to stress myself out more then people expect me to</p>
