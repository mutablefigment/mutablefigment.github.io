I left feeling pretty annoyed having invested my sanity into writing this project with a 2 day delivery window as well as having to work a stressful 8 hour work day on top.<br>In the end I can only blame myself for having the idea and even proposing such an insane project for a technical interview. No fault on their side, yet I would have at least wished for a more in depth talk about my efforts.</p><p>It all comes back to the old adage “we did it not because it was easy, but because we thought it would be easy”</p><p>To round it all off I have to say the company was a great place to work at even though I left a bit disappointed that evening, it felt like a family and work was pretty fun there all things considered :)</p><p>Alas on to a new company with new projects to stress myself out more then people expect me to</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
