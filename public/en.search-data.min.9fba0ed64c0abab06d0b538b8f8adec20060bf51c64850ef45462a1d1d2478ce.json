I left feeling pretty annoyed having invested my sanity into writing this project with a 2 day delivery window as well as having to work a stressful 8 hour work day on top.\nIn the end I can only blame myself for having the idea and even proposing such an insane project for a technical interview. No fault on their side, yet I would have at least wished for a more in depth talk about my efforts.\nIt all comes back to the old adage “we did it not because it was easy, but because we thought it would be easy”\nTo round it all off I have to say the company was a great place to work at even though I left a bit disappointed that evening, it felt like a family and work was pretty fun there all things considered :)\nAlas on to a new company with new projects to stress myself out more then people expect me to\n"}]
