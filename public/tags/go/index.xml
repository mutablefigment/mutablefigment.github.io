The age of vibe coding is here, but maybe I am doing it wrong I am paying for perplexity pro, GitHub co pilot and even Kagi premium because I thought I wanna give vibe coding a try maybe it can help me improve my dev workflow and help me finish side projects that have been ignored by be for months or even years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But as much as I would like the vibe to code itself it just doesn’t fucking work.&lt;br>
I get an idea start a new thread with one of may of the best in class “ai models” like in perplexity space with for example something rather simple like “I wanna create a matrix bot in python that just echos messages back to me” and it thinks for a good 13 minutes does its research and spits out some pretty convincing code, and in the nature of the vibe coder I just run it … fuck it what’s the worst that could happen anyway right?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
