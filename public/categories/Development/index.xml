      <description>&lt;p&gt;I keep arguing with LLMS &lt;br&gt;&#xA;The age of vibe coding is here, but maybe I am doing it wrong I am paying for perplexity pro, GitHub co pilot and even Kagi premium because I thought I wanna give vibe coding a try maybe it can help me improve my dev workflow and help me finish side projects that have been ignored by be for months or even years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as much as I would like the vibe to code itself it just doesn’t fucking work.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I get an idea start a new thread with one of may of the best in class “ai models” like in perplexity space with for example something rather simple like “I wanna create a matrix bot in python that just echos messages back to me” and it thinks for a good 13 minutes does its research and spits out some pretty convincing code, and in the nature of the vibe coder I just run it … fuck it what’s the worst that could happen anyway right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking for a job is never fun so I was pretty happy when I got an offer for a dev position and it even was in the language I had my first real job in (and that I still love) Delphi&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Delphi jobs being rare af I was pretty stoked to be able to work in Delphi again and with some nice people that all were pretty friendly in the interviews&lt;/p&gt;</description>
