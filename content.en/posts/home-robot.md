# Building a small robot with tracks for fun and no profit (part 0)

Sometime ago I decided I wanna build something related to electronics and programming.
After talking with some of my friends, I have decided that I want to build a small robot
that can drive around my apartment, can see using a camera and somesort of vision processing
as well as speak.
For the language intensive parts I decided to use an `Ollama` instance running on my local
`NixOS cluster`.
